# 2 : ðŸŽ± Programming a guessing game

## ðŸ‘‰ Prelude

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the **prelude**.

If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a ***use*** statement.

---

## ðŸ‘‰ Associated Function

A function that's implemented on a type.

For Example - 
```rust
String::new()
```
Here the `::` syntax shows that the new is the associated function declared on type String.

---

`read_line` puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a **Result** value.

## ðŸ‘‰ Result

Result is an enumeration, often called an **enum**, which is a type that can be in one of **multiple possible states**. We call each possible state a **variant**.

### Variants of Result -

- **Ok** - Indicates the operation was successful, and it contains the successfully generated value.
- **Err** - Means the operation failed, and it contains information about how or why the operation failed.

An instance of **Result** has an `expect` method that you can call. 

If this instance of Result is an `Err` value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to `expect`.

If this instance of Result is an `Ok` value, `expect` will take the return value that `Ok` is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.

## ðŸ‘‰ Crate

Crate is a collection of **Rust source code files**.

### 2 types of crates - 

- **Binary Crate** - Contains executable rust source code files.
- **Library Crate** - Contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and canâ€™t be executed on its own. 

## ðŸ‘‰ Ordering

Import line - `std::cmp::Ordering`

The **Ordering** type is another **enum** and has the variants **Less**, **Greater**, and **Equal**.

## ðŸ‘‰ Cmp

The **cmp** method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with. Then it returns a variant of the **Ordering** enum.

We use a **match** expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of **Ordering** was returned from the call to **cmp**.

## ðŸ‘‰ Match

A **match** expression is made up of ***arms***. An **arm** consists of a pattern to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to match fits that armâ€™s pattern. Rust takes the value given to match and looks through each armâ€™s pattern in turn.

The match expression ends after the first successful match.
