# Rust-Refined 🦀

![rust logo image](rust_logo.png)

A **concise, refined, and straight-to-the-point summary** of the official [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).  
This repository documents **every important line, note, and insight** from each chapter — no fluff, no noise — just what matters.  

---

## ✨ Purpose

- Provide Rust learners with a **faster, sharper way** to study the Rust book.  
- Ensure **no important concept is skipped** — everything crucial from the original book is captured.  
- Act as a **reference guide** when revisiting Rust topics without rereading the entire book.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- Each **chapter** is a folder.  
- Each **sub-topic** is its own `.md` file.
