# Comments

In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the comment continues until the end of the line. 

For comments that extend beyond a single line, youâ€™ll need to include `//` on each line ðŸ¥², like this:

```rust
// So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what's going on.
```

Rust also has another kind of comment, **documentation comments**, which we will discuss further.
